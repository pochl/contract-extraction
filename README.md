# AI for Contract Review: Clause Extraction
This project adopts Question-Answering NLP model to perform clause extraction task, by following closely to the approach from the paper [CUAD: An Expert-Annotated NLP Dataset for Legal Contract Review](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.06268.pdf). Their [github](https://github.com/TheAtticusProject/cuad) page also provides us with the dataset and the fine-tune models. 

Since the CUAD daaset does not contain the lables for all clauses in our specific requirement, the aim of this project is to fine-tune the model on our own dataset and other public dataset that we can currate, as well as to experiemnt with outher language models that could lead to better performance in legal text.
